A semi-finished graphing application for mathematical formulae with 2 variables
Based on the algorithm in Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables by Jeff Tupper of University of Toronto
Only +-*/ sqrt sin cos tan atan are supported
Cannot handle function breakpoints 
Inequality signs can be used in implicit functions
